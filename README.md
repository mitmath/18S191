## Fall 2020 (9 Units)

Welcome to the new MIT course 18.S191!

This is an introductory course on Computational Thinking, using the modern [Julia programming language](http://www.julialang.org), to approach real-world problems in the following areas via data analysis and computational and mathematical modeling.  In this class you will learn applications, computer science, software, algorithms, and mathematics as an integrated whole.

- Image analysis
- Particle dynamics and ray tracing
- Epidemic propagation
- Climate modeling


### Course Materials
Course materials will be posted [here](course-materials.md).

Julia learning materials may be found [here](http://www.julialang.org/learning)

### Evaluation

*   12 weekly problem sets with equal weight; your lowest score will be dropped. 

*   Released on Thursdays and due before the following Thursday's class. (No problem set during Thanskgiving week.)

*   No exams

Problem sets consist of coding and will be submitted online via Canvas.
